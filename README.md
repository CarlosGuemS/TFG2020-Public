# TFG2020-Public
Code used for my final project in my undergad at the UPV. Pretty much all of it except the parts I'm not allowed to distribute (i.e. the datasets).

More info about the datasets at CASAS/dataset_info.txt. If you are to run this it may requiere additional downloads.

This product includes software developed by scikit-learn developers. The Conditional Random Fields also uses the [sklearn-crfsuite library](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/sklearn-crfsuite).
